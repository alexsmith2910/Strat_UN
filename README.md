This is the pyglet branch of the Strat_UN git.

Currently this branch has:
  - random generation of map (random colour of ground tiles and basic water generation
  - player that moves per tile (15 frame delay on a frame rate of 120 = 0.15 seconds)
  - detection of player on specific tiles (currently source water only - dark blue)
  - a generic Building class to be used to create functional buildings
  - a drill which allows for resources to be 'mined' for the player to use
